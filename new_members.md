#How to Help

###Here are some issues we can use your help with right now!

1. We use [GitHub](https://github.com/) to house our codebase and [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) for open source changes. You will need an account with GitHub to make code contributions.
2. Pick an issue that interests you and clone the repo. Each repo has a ReadMe that gives setup instructions. If you have issues, we're happy to help.
3. Create a branch, test your code, and submit a pull request when you're ready. Participate in the issue chats to let us now what you have going on.
4. Allow a member to look over your code and when it is approved, we'll pull it in.
5. Feel the sweet success of coding for your community!

##We Need More than Just Coders
- **Interested in Event Planning?** We are always planning our next big event, so someone to help with the logistics will always be needed.
- **Interested in PR and Marketing?** Help spread the word about our apps to the public. Facebook, Twitter, etc. If an app is fully developed and deployed, but there is no one to use it, does it make a sound?
- **Interested in Copy and/or Content Writing?** Writing blog posts, creating flyers and brochures, and helping with content is a must.
- **Interested in Photography?** We would love beautiful photos to include in our sites whether it is of our events or Nashville at large.
- **Interested in Design?** Help make our apps look and feel beautiful. Design logos and layouts for our promotional materials. If you think some of our sites can use a makeover, send us your designs!
