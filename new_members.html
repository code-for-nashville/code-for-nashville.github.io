        <h2>How to Help (Coders)</h2>
        <h3>Here are some issues we can use your help with right now!</h3>
        <p>We use <a href="https://github.com/code-for-nashville">GitHub</a> to house our codebase and <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html">GitHub Flow</a> for open source changes. You will need an account with GitHub to make code contributions.</p>
        <p>Pick an issue that interests you and clone the repo. Each repo has a ReadMe that gives setup instructions. If you have issues, we're happy to help.</p>
        <p>Create a branch, test your code, and submit a pull request when you're ready. Participate in the issue chats to let us now what you have going on.</p>
        <p>Allow a member to look over your code and when it is approved, we'll pull it in.</p>
        <p>Feel the sweet success of coding for your community!</p>
