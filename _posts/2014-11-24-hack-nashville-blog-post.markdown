In early November, Code for Nashville jumped on the opportunity to use Hack Nashville as a way to kick off its first in-house app.

At the sixth installment of the local hackathon, held Nov. 7-9, a few CfN members showed up armed with only a vague idea for an app envisioned as a one-stop shop for residents, would-be residents, and businesses to go to find what part of town has the most amenities important to them.

Following the Hack Nashville project proposals where the app was pitched before all of the attendees, the CfN group grew to include members of the Nashville Software School as well as several local professional developers. The team took turns working at various times over the weekend both at Hack Nashville and at home.

The fruit of that weekend’s work, tentatively called NashViva, taps data sets from Metro Nashville’s Open Data Portal (data.nashville.gov), scrapes the appropriate JSON data, and creates a map with that information using the Leaflet JavaScript library. Users can toggle different datasets on and off to display the combination of amenities that they desire.

For Hack Nashville, the team limited the scope of amenities to just four — police precincts, fire stations, parks and free wifi. Having created a working proof-of-concept app, team members demoed the app for the Hack Nashville exposition on Sunday, Nov. 9, stirring up interest for both the app and also for CfN itself.

Team members are now working on developing it into a full-fledged app as well as the group’s first full project built from concept to completion. Next up will be to determine what all datasets to include as well as the best ways for users to interact with the app and get the most out of it.
