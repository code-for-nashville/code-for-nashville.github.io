Code for Nashville is hosting a CodeAcross event this year, and to get into the civic hacking spirit, we will be writing a series of blogs leading up to the event centered around this year’s theme: Principles for 21st Century Government. So get excited, there’s good to be done.

#####Principle 1: Design for People’s Needs
What a seemingly straightforward principle. It is so straightforward that, as it turns out, it is often an overlooked detail, even for highly developed apps. Developers can take a seemingly great idea, labor over the development of the technology, only to be left with an app that no one has use for. The important point to take from this principle is the need to take a step back and look at the larger context of a potential app. This can be hard: people have great ideas that they get very excited about, and dive right into the technical work, without ever asking who the end user will be, or if it’s even needed. Developing an ongoing relationship between end users and developers is key to creating useful and lasting apps for a community.

Just as governments must consider the day to day needs of its community, so must a community understand what its government needs to work effectively. In the Nashville Brigade’s work with local metro government offices, it has become clear how important this principle is to remember. All sides are eager to develop new apps to make our lives better, but without continuous communication between a brigade and local government, we cannot know if a seemingly great app idea would be viable for real world use. Because of this, all app ideas, from government or brigade members, should be clearly outlined and submitted to all relevant parties. This way, the end user can explain their needs directly to the developer, and the developer can help explain what is possible towards that goal.
When this open communication and collaboration exists between government, developers and community members, time and energy need not be wasted. The people (or government’s) needs are identified and applications are developed to meet those needs.
