As one of the first actions as a group, many of those who would make up the fledgling leadership of the Code for Nashville brigade gathered in mid-September over pizza in Midtown to meet with Preston Rhea, brigade program coordinator for Code for America.

Rhea provided direction to the nascent brigade by laying out three areas to focus on in the beginning: people, plan and partnerships. CfN, he said, already had a jumpstart on a strategic plan as crafted by leader John Chapin, but the keys for growing into a sustainable organization would lie in tapping those with the right skills and representativeness as well as identifying organizations — both technical and nontechnical — with which to potentially partner down the road.

CfN envisioned teaming up with local charity organizations, schools, foundations and other groups that may have needs to connect people with either data or other people or both. This outreach will ideally include working with Code for America brigades in other regions as well.

At this meeting, members also laid out the structure of its monthly “hack nights,” CfN’s main events of action. It’s at these hack nights, on the third Wednesday of every month at the Sevier Park Community Center, where the brigade discusses ongoing and future projects before breaking out into groups and digging into code and data.

An ongoing challenge for CfN will be to identify particular datasets, especially those available through the [Nashville Open Data Portal], that members can work with to get the most out of for users. CfN member Yiaway Yeh, who also works in the mayor’s Nashville Office of Innovation, told other members at that September dinner that other available datasets have been identified. Now, brigade members will try to provide input to the city on what dataset releases might take priority over others.

If you have ideas to share about data available through the Nashville Open Data Portal or how Nashvillians might be able to use such data, please contact us.

And stay tuned.
