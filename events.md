##National Day of Civic Hacking
Jun 6th, 8am-8pm

Where: Music City Center, 201 5th Avenue South Nashville

Thousands of people from across the United States will come together for National Day of Civic Hacking. The event will bring together urbanists, civic hackers, government staff, developers, designers, community organizers and anyone with the passion to make their city better. They will collaboratively build new solutions using publicly-released data, technology, and design processes to improve our communities and the governments that serve them. Anyone can participate; you donâ€™t have to be an expert in technology, you just have to care about your neighborhood and community.
